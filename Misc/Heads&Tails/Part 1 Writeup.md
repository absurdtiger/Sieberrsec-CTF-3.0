## Solution
my go to tool for looking at file bytes is cyberchef

because GUI (sue me) and search function and copy pasting is just easier 

granted, cyberchef is not so good on huge files. regardless, we can see the first part immediately just after the file header

and the second part of the answer is at the end of the file (clued by "tails)
