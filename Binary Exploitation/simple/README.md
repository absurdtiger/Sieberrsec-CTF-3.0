Simple game right?

```c

## solution
this one was weird. lol. 

as someone who doesn't understand c, I hoped that the low relative points and high number of solves meant that I could wing it. 

sending any non-numerical character made the program crash. <br>
the next reasonable thing is to spam a reaaaally high number. 

my original solve was sending a bunch of 9s, seeing the bank bal go up by one, sending again, seeding it go up by one more, sending again with fewer, seeing a negative value, freaking out and spamming more than previously and thankfully the flag appeared. 

after actually reading the source code and testing a bit more, here's what I think is happening. 

- sending 16 bytes will always return the flag 

brb haven't figured it out yet
