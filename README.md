# Sieberrsec-CTF-3.0
My attempt to understand this CTF. bad bad bad go elsewhere for proper writeups

Sieberrsec CTF 2021 was organised by the folks at https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/

I participated with burp in the secondary school category and we placed 6th, with 16th overall. Burp's points doubled mine, so it's clear who's the better one. He also managed to fb something lucky man 

## Proper writeups by professionals

## Things you should know before reading anything inside
1) I made this completely selfishly to gain the benefits of public accountability on my progression from noob to slightly less of a noob. 
2) Just because a writeup is included doesn't mean I successfully attempted it during the competition. These are just notes. Also, there'll be update lag for the ones burp did. 
3) The writing is highly informal and conversational intentionally because I want to put less pressure on myself to make something polished. I insist that this will be a fun project.
4) Hence you may derive entertainment from this project.
5) The level of understanding of these writeups fits my own. Which is very low. The writeups for the challs I can't do/understand are nonexistent for this reason. 
6) This repo will probably be dynamic in that I will likely add things when I reattempt challs in the future. 
7) I also made this to 'get better at github'. Pardon if any conventions are broken throughout this repo. 
8) I also made this to refer back to challs when sean inevitably tasks me to make challs for [redacted]. so selfish, I know. 

## Things you don't have to know but you can 
1. This was one of my "I can't do anything else until I see it materialise" projects where I have creative epiphany in full visualisation and I cannot forgive myself if I never see the possibility come to fruition 
2. why did I envision myself making ctf writeups? i have no idea man 
3. maybe I just like documenting useless information 
4. side-effect of formal education
5. I tried to be systematic in the writing of writeups but no soooo
