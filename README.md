## Things you should know before reading anything inside
1) I made this completely selfishly to gain the benefits of public accountability on my progression from noob to slightly less of a noob. 
2) The writing is highly informal and conversational intentionally because I want to put less pressure on myself to make something polished. I insist that this will be a fun project.
3) Hence you may derive entertainment from this project.
4) The level of understanding of these writeups fits my own. Which is very low. The writeups for the challs I can't do/understand are nonexistent for this reason. 
5) This repo will probably be dynamic in that I will likely add things when I reattempt challs in the future. 

## Things you don't have to know but you can 
1. This was one of my "I can't do anything else until I see it materialise" projects where I have creative epiphany in full visualisation and I cannot forgive myself if I never see the possibility come to fruition 
2. why did I envision myself making ctf writeups? i have no idea man 
3. maybe I just like documenting useless information 
4. side-effect of formal education
