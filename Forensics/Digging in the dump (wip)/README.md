## Description

Our friend, Alex, used to visit a website, but ever since his computer died the url to the website was lost!

The only hope now lies in his old hard drive, which was salvaged from his pc

Hopefully something useful can be found

Here is a dump of his %APPDATA% folder

Can you help him find the website?

After finding that website, perhaps you can find the saved credentials to login to his account?
(Using the same file in Pt. I)

Computer username: Alex <br>
Computer password: Password1 <br>
(These are NOT the login credentials for the website)
